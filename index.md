Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a showcase of my projects, research, and achievements in fields ranging from autonomous drones and rovers to neural network optimizations. With a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, I have engaged in diverse projects that bridge technology and innovation.

My journey began with a fascination for robotics and space exploration, which led me to explore various applications of artificial intelligence. As the Head of the Machine Learning Club at my institute, I mentored fellow students and fostered collaboration on cutting-edge projects, particularly in areas such as Quantum Machine Learning and its applications in sound classification, Reinforcement Learning and Anomaly Detection.

I am also an avid gaming enthusiast, which has significantly influenced my approach to problem-solving and creativity in technology. The strategic thinking and quick decision-making skills honed through gaming often translate into my projects, especially in simulations and real-time systems.

I'm passionate about the practical implications of my work, as evidenced by my participation in international competitions like the International Rover Challenge and the International Space Drone Challenge, where my team has earned recognition for our innovative designs and solutions.

In my free time, I delve into research papers and explore new techniques in computer vision and deep learning, always seeking to expand my knowledge and stay at the forefront of technology.
